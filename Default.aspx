        <h1>Yellowstone National Park</h1>
        <p class="lead">On March 1, 1872, Yellowstone became the first national park for all to enjoy the unique hydrothermal and geologic wonders. Theses wonders were captured a year earlier in the art of William Henry Jackson’s photographs, Thomas Moran’s paintings, and Henry Elliot’s sketches during the 1871 Hayden Expedition. Their work inspired Congress to preserve the area.</p>
